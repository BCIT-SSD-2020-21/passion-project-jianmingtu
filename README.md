## Overview
The goal of the Passion Project module is to provide each student with an opportunity to individually explore and expand their abilities within a hands-on project-based setting.

The student will perform all roles including:
* Product Owner
* Product Designer/Planner
* Project Manager
* Designer
* Dev Ops
* Developer

Students are encouraged to work independantly (or in small groups of 2 or 3 if there is a shared passion). 

Students are able to use the tech stack of their choice. 

## Outcomes
Leading up to this point in our program you were asked to plan, design, and start to develop a product of your choosing. Given your increased experience with web and mobile technologies, you will be provided with class time to perform the tasks necessary to result in the following:

* A deployed main branch of any web based project assets.
* A clearly defined document with installation instructions as well as links and descriptions for all project assets.
* A project board that shows all of your build activitites (GitHub Project, Trello, etc.)
* A 5 minute presentation of the primary use cases for your application.

## Process
* Review your original product plan and design.
* Make changes to your plan/design where necessary to ensure that you can have a completed product for the Passion project demo day.
* Set specific milestones for your project, this will help to ensure that primary use cases are built in priority sequence and functional to a required minimum. (Not all milestones need to be completed...)
* All commits are to be done on a branch other than main and connected to a GitHub "issue". If working alone you can review and merge your own pull requests.

## Essential Features
These are really based on the design of your application and up to you...The only requirements are that each application has:
* some form persistant data that requires a database
* an implementation of a user interface that appropriately ties the app to the persisted data.

All other features should be included on an as needed basis for your application.

## Due Date and Grading
Presentations will take place 1pm-4pm PST April 16th, 2021.

The due date for graded code to be on GitHub is 11:59pm April 18th, 2021.

The passion project accounts for 20% of your SSDP5001 mark.
